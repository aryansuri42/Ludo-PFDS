# Ludo-Project for Beginner
Project is made using pygame and numpy
The numpy file which is used for mapping the entire LUDO board can be simplified further
Further all players are manual but this can be done by adding options for the user and either making other colours played by computer or just restricting the colours to load
can be done by using basic python.
